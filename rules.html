   <h1>Welcome to musicGame</h1>
   <h3>Here are the rules:</h3>

      <p>At least 4 people if you wanna have fun</p>
      <p>Some type of timer, that can be set to between 30-60 seconds </p>
      <p>A room with a length of at least 4 meters</p>

   <h3>How is it played:</h3>
   <p>Two and two you're gonna compete against other pairs (one pair at a time and stand around 4 meters from eachother)
      by singing a song from the artist that you see, <br> if your partner guess the right artist you switch place and continue like this until your time is up. <br>
      Only one person from the team should see the screen with the artist. </p>
<p>You can do hardcore with around 30 seconds or take a full minute if you like. For every artist you guess correct you get a score. All teams should pick a scorecolor. Left click with the mouse to add a score, and right click to remove a score.
   The scores are saved until you close the window. If you refresh the page the scores are saved. Note that, if you refresh the page the list of artists will start over, and artists you've already had might show up. So try not to refresh.</p>

<p>To get a new random artist, simply click New artist-button or just hit 'Enter' on the keyboard.
   If you don't kow the song or artist just pass and get a new artist.</p>
