   <h1 class="centerText">Welcome to musicGame</h1>
   <h3>Here are the rules:</h3>

      <p>At least 4 people if you wanna have fun</p>
      <p>Some type of timer, that can be set to between 30-60 seconds </p>
      <p>A room with a length of at least 4 meters</p>

   <h3>How is it played:</h3>
   <p>Two and two you're gonna compete against other pairs (one pair at a time and stand around 4 meters from eachother) by singing a song from the artist that you see, <br> if your partner guess the right artist you switch place and coninue like this until your time is up. <br> Only one person from the team should see the screen with the Artist, so the screen have to be behind of of the persons. </p>
<p>You can do hardcore with around 30 seconds or take a full minute if you like. For every artist you guess you get a score.</p>
<p>Where you play the game you see a white box where you can add your team names and keep track ofr your score. Like this: </p>
<p><i>Team 1: 3</i></p>
<p><i>Team 2: 2</i></p>
<p><i>Team 3: 0</i></p>
<p>If you guess the right artist, a third person should be ready to either click on the New Artist-button or simply just hit 'Enter' on the keyboard. You should also click the button or hit Enter if you don't know the artist or song.</p>
<p>Ps. If you switch between clicking the button and hitting enter it might act a little weird, simply hit refresh and then load you scores again and you are good to go.</p>
